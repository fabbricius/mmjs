		<p>Work in progress. Play Manic Miner in your web browser! Guide Miner Willy using LEFT, RIGHT and SPACE or a joystick (using my <a href="/toolbox/joystick/">joystick plug-in</a>). The game graphics and layout are taken directly from the Sinclair Spectrum version. The completed project will feature a map and sprite editor.</p>
		<p>Please let me know if you have problems getting the game to work - I'd especially like to hear from Safari users (1.0 doesn't work but newer versions should) and anyone experiencing slow level loading (where the screen is built up one block at a time rather than all at once).</p>
		<p>The game window should launch automatically but if it doesn't (you have a pop-up blocker installed, for example) just click here: <button onclick="popup()">Launch</button></p>
		<p>Plus, here's one of the <a href="eugene/">unofficial Manic Miner sequels</a> running using an older version of the same JavaScript engine.</p>
