Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/mmjs

Hello,

This is the Github import of the mmjs, also known as Manic Miner Javascript. 
Manic Miner is a game from 80's.

Please note that I am not the original author of mmjs, but I was afraid not to find it after closing of Google Code, so I saved it.

So far I failed to contact the original author but I will retry soon.

The future of this repository:
-more comment in code
-a wiki explaining how it works
-Eventually a port to HTML5 would be fine.
